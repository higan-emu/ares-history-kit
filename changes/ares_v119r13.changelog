GoldenEye 007 and Jet Force Gemini run now. Right now, known N64 bugs are:
Donkey Kong 64 hangs when the EEPROM support is enabled, Indiana Jones doesn't
boot (probably anti-emulator code?), Blast Corps blinks a lot (though less than
it did before.)

This WIP has CPU instruction and data cache emulation, though I had to disable
the data cache as it's not working yet.
