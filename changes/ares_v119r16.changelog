  - Mega Drive: VDP scanline renderer compiles once more
  - Nintendo 64: improved dynamic recompiler
  - PlayStation: began adapting CPU cached interpreter into a dynamic
    recompiler
  - lucia: allow mapping analog axes separately (allows mapping sticks to
    the keyboard)

All that's left now is fixing the call() function in the N64/PS1 to support >3
(4) arguments on Windows and we can release v120
