That's as far as I can go with 32X support for now. I fully emulated the Sh2 cache but I still hang at Mars test 123. The Hblank (2) test fails because it looks like I'm running a bit too fast. The DMA test fails because it expects DREQ to become inactive when the DREQ length hits zero. If I do that, the test hangs. If I don't do that, the test fails.

Virtua Fighter shows no graphics in-game, Virtua Racing shows no graphics period.
