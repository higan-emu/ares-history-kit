Knuckles Chaotix is now fully playable at glorious 20fps, heh.

Still a whole ton of issues but I really went to town with this WIP. I implemented read/write functionality for all the SH7804 internal registers/functional units, and added basic simulation of the free-range timer, DMA controller (very basic) and interrupt controller.

On the 32X side, it should be functionally complete save for bugs now. VDP and PWM are fully implemented.
